I am a third-year Ph.D. student in [the Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). I am currently advised by [Jidong Zhai](https://pacman.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~zjd/) in the [PACMAN](https://pacman.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) group.

Research
======
My passion lies in efficient machine learning systems. I am building systems to accelerate machine learning applications on various hardware. I am always eager to engage in conversations and collaborate with others who share my passion for this field.

Projects
======
- [InfiniTensor](https://github.com/InfiniTensor/InfiniTensor) is a high-performance inference engine tailored for GPUs and AI accelerators. Its design focuses on effective deployment and swift academic validation.
- [Vapro](https://github.com/thu-pacman/VAPRO) is a performance profiler to detect and diagnose performance variance (i.e., performance degradation and jitters) for parallel applications.
